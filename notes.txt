I've had to make some assumptions about UI decisions, and I'm not clear on where the error handling will take place, but it will be simple enough to modify that code. 

The CatCaloricCalculator is currently using the formula 70 * Math.pow(this.cat.weight, 0.75) to obtain the restingEnergyRequirement. The FEDIAF guidelines linked above state that a formula of 70 * Math.pow(this.cat.weight, 0.67) is more accurate if using metabolizableEnergy instead of Gross Energy. Which is listed on the packaging may vary depending on the manufacturer. 

The MacroAnalyzer formula requires an input for ash, but this may be difficult to determine if it is not listed on the packaging - and the first example I looked at did not (but they did list their calories in terms of metabolizableEnergy). If ash is not listed on the packaging, I have not been able to find a simple and reliable method for determining it's content level.

"When ash is used related to animal foods, it means minerals â€“ calcium, phosphorus, iron, copper, zinc, etc. Ash is a crude measurement of the total amounts of minerals in a diet."
